## My Process

### Built With

`<h1>Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>`

css

Copy code

`body {
  font-family: Montserrat;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}`

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my skills in:

- Advanced CSS techniques
- JavaScript interactivity
- Accessibility best practices
